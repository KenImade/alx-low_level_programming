# C - Variables, if, else, while

This project is part of the ALx Full Stack Software Engineering programme.

The objectives of this project are the following:

- What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
- What are the logical operators
- What the the relational operators and how to use them
- How to use the `if, if ... else` statements
- How to declare variables of types `char`, `int`, `unsigned int`
- How to print the values of variables of type `char`, `int`, `unsigned int` with `printf`
- How to use the `while` loop
- How to print variables using `printf`

| S/N | File | Description |
| --- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| 1 | 0-positive_or_negative.c |  Program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed and print the value of the number and if it is positive, negative or zero. |
| 2 | 1-last-digit.c | Program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed and print the last digit and check for the following:<ul><li>if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5</li><li>if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0</li><li>if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0</li></ul> |
| 3 | 2-print_alphabet.c | Prints the alphabet in lowercase |
| 4 | 3-print_alphabets.c | Prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line. |
| 5 | 4-print_alphabet.c | Prints the alphabet except the letters `q` and `e` |
| 6 | 5-print_numbers.c | Prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line. |
| 7 | 6-print_number.c | Prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, using `putchar`|
