# C - Variables, if, else, while

This project is part of the ALx Full Stack Software Engineering programme.

The objectives of this project are the following:

- What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
- What are the logical operators
- What the the relational operators and how to use them
- How to use the `if, if ... else` statements
- How to declare variables of types `char`, `int`, `unsigned int`
- How to print the values of variables of type `char`, `int`, `unsigned int` with `printf`
- How to use the `while` loop
- How to print variables using `printf`

| --- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| 1 | 0-positive_or_negative.c |  Program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed and print the value of the number and if it is positive, negative or zero. |
| 2 | 1-last-digit.c | Program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed and print the last digit and check for the following:<ul><li>if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5</li><li>if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0</li><li>if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0</li></ul> |
