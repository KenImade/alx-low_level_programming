# C - Hello, World

This project is part of the ALx Full Stack Software Engineering program.

The objectives of this project are the following:
- What happens when you type `gcc main.c`
- What is an entry point
- What is `main`
- How to print text using `printf`, `puts` and `putchar`
- How to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator `sizeof`
- How to compile using `gcc`

**All files are executable**
