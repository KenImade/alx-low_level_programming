# C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings

This project is part of the ALx Full Stack Software Engineering programme.

The objectives of this project are:
- What are pointers to pointers and how to use them
- What are multidimensional arrays and how to use them
- What are the most common C standard library functions to maninpulate strings
