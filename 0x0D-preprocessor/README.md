# C - Preprocessor

This project is part of the ALx Full Stack Software Engineering Program

The objectives of this project are to learn the following:
- What are macros and how to use them
- What are the most common predefined macros
- How to include guard your header files

| S/N | File | Description |
| --- | ---- | ----------- |
| 1 | 0-object_like_macro.h | A header file that defines a macro named SIZE with value `1024` |
| 2 | 1-pi.h | A header file that defines a macro named PI with value `3.14159265359` |
| 3 | 2-main.c | A program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line |
| 4 | 3-function_like_macro.h | A function like macro `ABS(x)` that computes the absolute value of a number `x` |
| 5 | 4-sum.h | A function-like macro `SUM(x, y)` that computes the sum of the numbers `x` and `y` |
