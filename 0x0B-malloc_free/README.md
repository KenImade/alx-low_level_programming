# C - malloc, free

This project is part of the ALx Full Stack Software Engineering Program

The objectives of this project are to learn the following:

- What is the difference between automatic and dynamic allocation
- What is `malloc` and `free` and how to use them
- Why and when to use `malloc`
- How to use `valgrind` to check for memory leak

| 3 | 2-str_concat.c | A function that concatenates two strings |
| 4 | 3-alloc_grid.c | A function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers |
