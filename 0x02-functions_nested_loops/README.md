# C - Functions, nested loops

This project is part of the ALx Full Stack Software Engineering programme.

The objectives of this project are to explain the following:

- What are nested loops and how to use them
- What is a function and how do you use functions
- What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
- What is a prototype
- Scope of variables
- What are `header` files and how to to use them with `#include`
